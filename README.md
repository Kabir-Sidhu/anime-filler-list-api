# anime-filler-list-api
Unofficial API for animefillerlist.com made by scraping it.

# Use Live
You can use it live at https://afl.kabirssidhu.com

# How to run
Run `pip install bs4 flask requests` to install the modules, then run `python main.py` to start it.

It may a take a while to start, but when it does you can send a GET request to "/" to get the full filler list or to "/anime name" to get a list for that specific anime.
